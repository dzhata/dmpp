# DMPP

A Python-based, modular penetration testing framework that automates the orchestration of industry-standard tools (Nmap, Gobuster, Hydra, SQLMap, Metasploit, Empire, etc.) for end-to-end assessments. Designed for CLI-first workflows, extensibility, and robust headless operation on Kali Linux.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend or swap out tool drivers.
- **Automated Pipeline:** Fully automated multi-stage pentest pipeline.
- **Orchestrates Industry Tools:** Integrates Nmap, Hydra, SQLMap, Metasploit, Empire, etc.
- **Real Reporting:** Aggregates raw and parsed results for real-world analysis.
- **Session Management:** Tracks shells/creds/artifacts between tools for chained attacks.
- **CLI-First:** Zero GUI dependencies; ideal for virtualized or remote ops.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone & Install**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dzhata/dmpp
    cd dmpp
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Configure**
    - Edit `config.yaml` with tool paths, creds, and environment variables.

3. **Run Full Pipeline**
    ```sh
    python main.py --targets targets.txt --full
    ```
    - Or run stage-by-stage (see `--help`).

4. **View Results**
    - Raw tool outputs in `results/raw/`
    - Aggregated/final reports in `results/reports/`

## Tool Integration

- **Nmap** – Host/port/vuln scan & parsing
- **Gobuster** – Directory brute-force (optional)
- **Hydra** – Auth brute-force with form/cookie handoff
- **SQLMap** – Automated SQL injection after form discovery
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation, shell delivery, output parsing
- **Empire** – Post-exploitation, PowerShell/LinPE scripts

## Extending

- Add a new tool by creating a driver in `modules/`.
- Register it in the pipeline (`automated_pentest.py`).
- Write unit tests in `tests/`.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Kali Linux (recommended)**
- External tools: nmap, hydra, sqlmap, msfconsole, Empire (see config for paths)

## Notes

- Designed for headless/CLI operation (VirtualBox/VM/cloud).
- Raw logs and outputs are retained for auditing/replay.
- Logging and error handling are critical: check logs for troubleshooting.

## Third-Party Tools Notice

This framework automates, integrates, and orchestrates a number of external penetration testing tools, including but not limited to:

- Nmap (https://nmap.org/)
- Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra)
- SQLMap (https://sqlmap.org/)
- Metasploit Framework (https://metasploit.com/)
- Empire (https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire)

These tools are **not included** in this repository, nor are they authored or maintained by the DMPP project. Each tool is subject to its own license and terms of use. Please consult the respective upstream projects for their licensing, copyright, and usage restrictions.
